# Random Quote Generator

This is my response to the freeCodeCamp Practical Exercice: make a Random Quote Generator. It uses React to render the page.

## Notes to self

1. To get the right user in the pushes need to:
    1. modify the ```node_modules/gh-pages/bin/gh-pages.js``` to add ```{user: {name: "name", email: "email"}}``` to the options passed to gh-pages.
    2. run ```npm run deploy``` as before.
